    <p>Boiling the perfect egg can be hard, especially when there
        are many factors that can make or break your egg experience.
        Here is a list of ways to boil your egg to your preference.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Personally, I like to eat the eggs raw, but for normies I guess this recipe works too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>chunky ahh egg</li>
        <li>free tap water (if it not free dont drink it)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper because you have no taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>This is the fun part</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a pot. Oh wait, I forgot to tell you to get one oops</li>
        <li>Add tap water until it can submerge your eggs and feelings</li>
        <li>Boil water until its crying for help and bubbling</li>
        <li>Add the eggs in. DO NOT THROW THEM IN, THEY WILL RETALIATE</li>
        <li>Wait 7 minutes or until you forgot them and smell burning</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SPECIAL:</strong> If you like a hard-headed egg, cook for 10 minutes instead</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Take out IMMEDIATELY and rinse off with colder tap water</li>
        <li>If you actually read this, you can peel and eat now</li>
    </ol>
